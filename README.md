# C-ADS - Social network for programmers.

## Abbreviation of C-ADS: Computer-aided design systems.

#### We chose this name for the social network because we are C-ADS students.

For some it is a pain and a problem, for some it is a practical way to keep in touch with friends, for others it is
unjustified political fights in comments and a source of negativity, and for others it is a convenient tool to attract
audiences to their business product. You can discuss at length the advantages and disadvantages of social networks,
coming down to the norms of morality and generational differences.

The idea of our project is to create a social network for programmers. We decided to implement this idea, because in
ordinary social networks it is quite difficult for programmers to find like-minded people. It will be much easier for
people to find friends and like-minded people in our network, and young programmers will be able to find worthy mentors.

In our social network you can create your own "page" on which you can specify name, age, gender, knowledge of
programming languages =0, add photos, write a post, leave your own contacts for communication.
